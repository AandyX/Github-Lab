# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Survival

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A bullet hell game where you dodge projectiles and shoot the enemies.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will be a game made in pygame. Some features will include different enemies and weapon types. The player can only take a certain amount of hits before the game is over
and there will be a level selector. There should also be sound effects and music.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Atleast one level and different enemies and a working game (health, game over, win, etc.)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

More than 1 level with different weapon types and sound effects and music.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A gamemode where it is endless which slowly gets more difficult and the goal is to get the highest score possible.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I would need to start with pygame and learning the basics of that. Once I learn those skills, the first thing I would do is to code the player movement. Then the ability to shoot. Then I would
make an enemy that fights back. I will then have to incorporate health and a gameover or win screen. Then I would have to create a level selector and make some levels which is
basically different groups of enemies that appear in waves.
